# What is the kubernets service?
### Service serves as a stable static IP and DNS for the application, which gives us the option to communicate with the Pods.
### Containers(Pods) change all the time, they stop, start, get new IP, and the service is the solution for that.
### Service routes our requests to the correct Pods.
